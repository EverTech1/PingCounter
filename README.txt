Hud ping counter for minecraft 1.8.9

Color and position can be changed through the settings on the top left of the escape menu.

In case the settings button overlaps with other mods, it is possible to turn it off by setting "hideSettingsButton", in the config file, to true.

In the displayed text, $[ping] is replaced with the ping to the server. Leaving the text box empty will revert it to default.
